# Siege-Phalanx

I just found this script burried on an old laptop.

The idea is that it can be given a list of URLs and then parse and scan those URLs for all of the included URLS. The resulting list is then output.

The intent is to then have a realistic set of URLs to run Siege or AB against as a way of testing load.

## TODO

This definitely needs to be rewritten to use Composer to load QueryPath. With QP 3, the code is MUCH shorter.
